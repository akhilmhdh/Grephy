Internet Of Things abbreviated as IOT requires a new open source platform that is highly efficient, feature packed, and most importantly user friendly. Therefore I intend to create an IOT platform with all the latest data communication and managing for a seemingless user experience. The platform provides advance data visualisation, mapping, the most important Real Time Communication for smooth video, inter-devices data transfer. The platform is built using industrial favoured MERN framework and has strong security. From this project I hope to contribute an open source platform so that in future others can add more features and gets a complete free platform that provides maximum functions.
